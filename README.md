## Description

"Lubomila Lozanova's Portfolio" is a project, which was created with a framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page- Bootstrap. With this challenge, I would like to show my projects, information about me, my skills, how I can be contacted and external links leading to my resume and portfolio.
 This weekly activity targets particular skills, which I developed by this point - accessibility, flexbox, media queries,CSS variables and using Bootstrap.

 ## Usage
 The list shows what changes were made to improve the website:

- When the page is loaded the page presents my name, my logo, and links to sections about me, my projects,skills and contact information.
- Clicking on one of the sections in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. Dropdown menu was included as well.

- When Media Queries are applied, the navigation bar is changing to Mobile Navigation Bar,also called "Hamburger Menu".

- To apply the color palette easily, I used CSS Variables.
- "About Me" section includes information about me, my picture, an external link leading to my resume and a background picture.
- "Skills" section contains three cards with skills that I would like to achieve by the end of this course. To make them, I used a Bootstrap card layout.
- "Project" section includes three cards with information. External links were added and they are leading to my Portfolio websites- Behance and GitHub.
- The HTML links are displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been active or the mouse is over the link.
- "Contact Me" section includes three cards with contact information. 
- "Footer" contains three icons leading to external websites. 
- To make my site more user-friendly, I used icons. The icons' codes were taken from a website called "Font Awesome". 
- In order for the website to be responsive I used media queries in CSS styles according to the device's type.
   1.  I used media query with max-width: 992px, in order to target Large devices.

    ![730 px demo](./screenshot/730px.gif)
   The screen size in this demo is 730px.
   3.  I used media query with max-width: 600px and min-width: 400px, in order to target small devices (mobile phones).
